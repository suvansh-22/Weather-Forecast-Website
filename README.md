# Weather-Forecast-Website
This weather website is one of the first projects I developed when learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a straightforward but practical site that shows the current temperature for a specific location. The primary goal of creating this site was to put into practice and use the basic web development concepts I was learningâ€”such as organizing content with HTML, styling with CSS, and adding JavaScript to make the site interactive.

The site has a simple design where one can input a city name and see the temperature. I applied fundamental JavaScript to retrieve weather information from a third-party API and display it on the page dynamically. From this project, I learned by doing how to work with APIs, process user input, and update the content on the webpage without the need to refresh.

Although it is a straightforward project, it was an excellent learning experience that showed me how the front end works and how data can be made real with minimal code. I also emphasized creating the design responsive and clean visually using CSS, so the site loads smoothly on desktop as well as mobile.
